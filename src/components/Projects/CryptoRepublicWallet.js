        <strong>Situation:</strong> During my tenure at Republic,
        our team embarked on an ambitious project to create a
        self-custodial crypto wallet and introduce the digital
        Republic Note token. This initiative aimed to provide
        users with a secure and independent means to receive
        and manage digital assets directly, bypassing the need
        for third-party custodial services. The goal was to
        enhance security, user autonomy, and the overall user experience.

        <strong>Task:</strong> As part of a dedicated team of four engineers, we were responsible for end-to-end delivery of the project. Our responsibilities spanned across:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Planning and Design:</strong> Establishing the project requirements, creating architecture designs, and planning the development phases.</li>
          <li><strong>Development:</strong> Implementing both the front end and back end functionalities.</li>
          <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Ensuring the system was secure, reliable, and user-friendly through rigorous testing.</li>
          <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Successfully launching the product to the market.</li>
        </ul>
        The technologies we used included:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ruby on Rails:</strong> For back-end development, leveraging its convention over configuration approach for rapid development.</li>
          <li><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> As the database to ensure robust data management and transactions.</li>
          <li><strong>GraphQL:</strong> For efficient and flexible API communication between the front end and back end.</li>
          <li><strong>React with TypeScript:</strong> For building a robust, type-safe front-end application.</li>
        </ul>
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 5 }} className="project-description">
        <strong>Action:</strong> Our development process was collaborative and iterative, involving close coordination with various stakeholders and experts. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Prototyping and Design:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Collaboration with Designers:</strong> I worked closely with our designer to create a user-friendly prototype. We focused on intuitive navigation, security features, and seamless user experience.</li>
              <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> We gathered feedback from stakeholders and potential users early in the design phase to refine the prototype.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Back-End Development:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Database Schema Design:</strong> I led the design of the database schema in PostgreSQL. This involved defining tables for users, wallets, transactions, and the Republic Note tokens. Ensuring data integrity and security was paramount.</li>
              <li><strong>GraphQL API Development:</strong> I developed GraphQL models, types, resolvers, and mutations. This included creating secure endpoints for wallet creation, asset transactions, and balance inquiries.</li>
              <li><strong>Blockchain Integration:</strong> We worked closely with Wallaby, a blockchain integration team, to ensure seamless and secure interactions with the blockchain for token transactions and asset management.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Front-End Development:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>React with TypeScript:</strong> I implemented the front-end application using React and TypeScript, focusing on type safety and maintainability. This included developing components for user authentication, wallet management, transaction history, and secure asset transfers.</li>
              <li><strong>User Data Protection:</strong> We integrated advanced encryption techniques and secure storage solutions to protect user data and private keys.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Cross-Functional Collaboration:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Crypto Experts:</strong> Regular consultations with crypto experts ensured compliance with best practices in blockchain security and functionality.</li>
              <li><strong>DevOps Team:</strong> Collaborated with DevOps to set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, ensuring smooth and reliable deployment processes.</li>
              <li><strong>Quality Assurance (QA):</strong> Worked closely with QA to develop comprehensive test cases, perform extensive testing (including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests), and address any identified issues promptly.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
